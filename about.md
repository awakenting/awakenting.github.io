Hi,

I'm Andrej. I'm into neuroscience, open science and probably most other "open" things. I'm currently mostly reading about these topics and following discussions on Twitter (@awakenting) but plan to be more and more actively involved in the future. Writing about them on this site is one step in that direction.

Thank you for coming here and have a nice day :)
