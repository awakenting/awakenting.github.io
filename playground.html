<h1>Hi and wellcome to my playground. As I'm new in creating websites, so this is the place where I will try out different (fun) things. And the idea is to keep everything I try out on this page. I mean there should be enough space here (well at least in this moment I'm writing this.). Another idea is also to break out of the <span onmouseover="style.color='red'" onmouseout="style.color='white'">usual</span>, <b>sterile</b>, (<font size="2">boring?</font>) look of websites.</h1>

<div style="width:10000px; position:absolute">
For example, who says that text should always stay within a (invisible) box with a certain width? You can change that if you want to. Like this. I'm doing it right now. This line will just continue endlessly and by this point you might not even read it anymore because you'd have to scroll to the right to read it. So it doesn't even matter what I'm writing here. If you're still reading this you must be very curious if I'll write something interesting at some point but I can't promise that. Maybe I'll do. Maybe not. Vielleicht schreibe ich auch einfach auf einer anderen Sprache weiter. But maybe not. Anyway. . . . . . . . . . . Still reading? &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Okay. You win. I will tell you about one of my favorite blogs out there: <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve">Raw Nerve</a> by Aaron Swartz. You may know him from the documentary about him: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy">The Interent's Own Boy</a>. He was amazing.

<!--This is how I could let a "Hello" message pop up after 5 seconds:
<script>
    setTimeout(myFunction, 5000);
    
    function myFunction() {
      alert('Hello');
    }
</script>
