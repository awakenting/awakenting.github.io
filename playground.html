<h1>Hi and wellcome to my playground. As I'm new in creating websites, so this is the place where I will try out different (fun) things. And the idea is to keep everything I try out on this page. I mean there should be enough space here (well at least in this moment I'm writing this.). Another idea is also to break out of the <span onmouseover="style.color='red'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">usual</span>, <b>sterile</b>, (<small>boring</small>?) look of websites.</h1>


<div style="background-color:lightblue; position:absolute; top:10000px; left:300px">
  <h3>Well this looks awkward. What is this box doing here?</h3>

  <p style="font-size:100px">
  <br />
  <br />
  <br /></p>
    <p style="font-size:10px">
    I don't know.
    </p>
  <p style="font-size:100px">&#129335</p>
</div> 

 <div style="background-color:lightblue; position:absolute; top:300px; left:10000px">
  <h3>Well this loo... Okay this is just a copy of the box at the bottom (you should check it out).</h3>

  <p style="font-size:100px">
  <br />
  <br />
  <br /></p>
    <p style="font-size:10px">
    I don't know.
    </p>
  <p style="font-size:100px">&#129335</p>
</div>
